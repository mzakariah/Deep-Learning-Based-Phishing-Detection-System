# Deep-Learning-Based-Phishing-Detection-System
in this study, the objective is to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for phishing detection using the PhishTank dataset.
The objective was to build a model that could accurately identify phishing websites and improve the current state-of-the-art in phishing detection.
After preprocessing the PhishTank dataset, the CNN model is trained and evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is also obtained to visualize the model's performance and calculated the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) as a scalar summary of the model's ability to distinguish between phishing and non-phishing websites.
Based on the results, the CNN model achieved good performance on the PhishTank dataset and outperformed the baseline models. This highlights the potential of using deep learning models for phishing detection and suggests that the model can be used to improve the current state-of-the-art in this field.
Results of the study demonstrate the effectiveness of using a CNN model for phishing detection and provide a new direction for future research in this area. The findings suggest that this approach has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of phishing detection and make the internet a safer place for users.
